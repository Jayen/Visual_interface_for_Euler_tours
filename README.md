Visual interface for Euler tours
=========
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visual interface or Euler tours and Eulerisation algorithms for circuit board wiring.
--------------

This program allows user to input a undirected graph and visualise its
Euler tour if it has one. 3 algorithms are also implemented which can Eulerise the graph,
i.e add edges to the graph such that the resulting graph has a Euler tour.

The program takes in as input a .txt file which contains graph info in the
format defined in the help section of the program. Please see the test folder for examples.
The program draws the graph in a way such that no edges cross if possible.

Euler tour algorithms:
Fleury's algorithm
Hierholzer's algorithm

Eulerisation algorithm:
Nearest neighbour algorithm
Local search
Simulated annealing
